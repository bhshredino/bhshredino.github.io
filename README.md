My personal webpage.

Though I've worked a lot on this static webpage, the page is "NOT solely" my work .  
<br>
The base is a fork of  
https://github.com/hyperterminal-byte/hyperterminal-byte.github.io

and several things have been taken from  

https://github.com/techyminati/techyminati.github.io   
https://www.w3schools.com/ and  
https://github.com/cipheros/cipheros.github.io    

and modified as per my requirement.  

So i obviously have no problems anyone forking my page and using it to build their own webpage ! ( Just don't forget to change name(s) and hyperlinks)    
:)
